# 🎯 TicTacToe Game
Developed a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features an interactive, user-friendly interface that allows two players to engage in classic gameplay.

A web-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as part of my learning journey in front-end development. This project helped me understand fundamental concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.

## 🧩 About the Project

The goal of this project is to implement the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** (also known as **Noughts and Crosses**) game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking the spaces in the grid with either `X` or `O`. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project emphasizes **basic logic building**, **interactive UI**, and **responsive design** to deliver a smooth and fun gameplay experience.

## 💡 How the Game Works

1. **Game Board**  
   The board is a 3x3 grid created using a combination of HTML and styled with CSS.

2. **Player Turns**  
   Players alternate turns, and the current player is indicated through JavaScript logic.

3. **Win Logic**  
   After every move, the script checks all possible win conditions:
   - Three in a row (horizontal)
   - Three in a column (vertical)
   - Three diagonally

4. **Draw Logic**  
   If all cells are filled without a winner, the game is declared a draw.

5. **Reset Functionality**  
   A reset button allows the players to start a new game at any time.
